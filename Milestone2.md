## Project realization
> The bulk of the project work is centered on realizing the methodology you defined in Milestone 1. Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

>Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do.

>Documentation towards project realization will come in the form an intermediate project report. Your project report should be placed on GitHub in the same repository you used for Milestone 1. Create a new markdown file that contains the following.

```markdown
# Progress Report (insert date here)
## Overview
> (insert brief overview of efforts made)

## Outcomes
> (brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

> also list them out like this:
> * outcome 1
> * outcome 2

## Hinderances
> (insert brief discussion of challenges encountered)

## Ongoing Risks
> (address your project risks identified from Milestone 1 and update them based on your current progress, this should be a table)

```

> ### Submission materials
>For this submission, you should submit your progress report as a `.md` file in your project GitHub repository

## Diagrams
>In addition to the project documentation, you should produce a set of process or conceptual diagrams suited to your project. >This could be a set of activity diagrams for penetration-testing oriented projects, it could be software architecture diagrams for development-oriented projects, or it could be a process/conceptual model for other projects.

>For more information about different types of diagrams, see:

>### Submission materials
>You should create your diagrams using an architectural tool such as Lucidchart, MS Visio, or similar tools. You should include the diagram in your main project README.md file and in your Progress report in your GitHub repo, as an image and/or link to Lucidchart.
