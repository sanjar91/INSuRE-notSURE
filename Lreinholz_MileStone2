Project Overview 
	We have evaluated three domains (perimeter, EDR, Identity Management Systems) against the NIST 
  CSF controls and have created smaller and more specific control for each domain. We choose these 
  three domains because of the significant difference from each other. This process shows that 
  the process can be reused for other domains and is flexible in its implementation. 
  We used inter-rater reliability to see which controls should be used for each domain 
  and consensus-based approach for any items that didn't meet the IRR threshold. The 
  Narrowing of the controls allows for more meaningful questions to be asked in the survey 
  and gives a more accurate security maturity model based off of the questions.
	The NIST CSF has five groupings for the control (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).



Project Risks
  Resource restrictions 
  Time restrictions 
  The methodology is not universal 
  Identified measurements are not effective
  Identified measurements are too effective 
  Survey questions are bias 
  Survey questions are ambiguous  	

Project Hinderances
