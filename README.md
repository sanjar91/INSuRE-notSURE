# Cybersecurity Measurement Science

## Executive Summary - Lisa & Sarah

Cybersecurity departments across the United States all face a common problem: they spend loads of money and resources on implementing strong security controls with no standard way to measure the effectiveness of those controls.  There are numerous frameworks that exist, including the Cybersecurity Framework from NIST.  However, these frameworks typically are limited to identifying which controls to apply and do not include how to measure the effectiveness of the implemented controls.  As a result, there is a great need for a standard set of metrics which can measure the effectiveness of security controls that have been implemented in a given environment/domain.

The goal of this project is:
1) Determine if it is possible to use the Cybersecurity Framework from NIST (NIST-CSF) as a tool to determine the controls that should be in place for a security tool within the reference frame.  
2) Determine the rating/metric scale to determine the effectiveness of the controls
3) Determine if the rating/metric scale can be applied to the test organization

If this project is successful, the metrics will be able to provide a report card of a security environment/domain.  The end goal would be to be used in an overall report card of a security program effectiveness if all tools could be evaluated with the same standards.  

Team members that will be executing this project are:
1. Lisa Bazis
2. Sarah Noles
3. Collin Daily
4. Lyle Reinholz
5. Sanjar Hamidi

## Risk List - Everyone put one in
>As you will probably discover, there are many things that can go wrong when working on a project. Issues with skillsets, technology, team member availability, etc, may arise as the project goes forward. As we discussed in class, there are three options available to deal with project management risks: monitor it (Watch it), mitigate it (do something about it), accept it (give up). For milestone one, you should identify the major sources of risk and what you plan to do about them. Prepare a risk list and rank them by risk level using the standard formula, i.e. impact x likelihood, to describe the top 5 risks that might affect your team's ability to pull off the tasks identified in your timeline and dictated by your objectives.

|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Identified measurements are not effective (32) | 8 | 4 | One risk that affects us is that the metrics that we identify for measuring the effectiveness of a cybersecurity program could be ineffective. |
|Identified measurements are too effective (18) | 9 | 2 | One risk that could arise is that the current measurements for effectiveness are very effective leaving our work to be in vain. |

*This is Lisa's risk log-- please add to it
The methodology cannot be applied to all systems in the domain
The metrics cannot be standardized across all domains


## Project Methodology
>Methodology is extremely important for conducting a successful project. While I am always a fan of "winging it" when it comes to day-to-day life - winging it is not an option for being successful on a team. Hence, in this class you will be required to develop a technical plan (AKA Methodology) to succeed. Your methodology should be grounded in scientific method and best practice. It should be based on the literature in the area you are working on and should use well-tested methods when possible.  
>Requirements are extremely important for conducting a successful project - of either the creative or assessment-oriented varieties. Collecting requirements about an application means understand what your end user (or what the end user of a product you are assessing) is going to do with the product. To understand requirements we often define user stories and use cases to encapsulate and represent behavior.  
> Submission Requirements

Sanjar & Collin:
> - Literature Review: For milestone 1, you should prepare a literature review document that surveys the various research and development work in your project area. Your literature review should identify important keywords, relevant research papers, and the state of the art in your area.

Lyle:
> - Technical Plan: Once you have examined the relevant literature, you should prepare a technical plan that outlines and defines your methodology. Important consideration should be made to ensure that your methodology uses the literature to the best extent possible. Your technical plan should provide a detailed description of exactly what and how you will do what you plan to do.  Any data collection, testing/development methods, architectures, and data analysis techniques that you wish to use should all be included in your technical plan.

## Requirements
> Clearly identify the technologies and products involved in your project.  clearly identify the technologies, products, and languages involved in your project. Include a table that identifies which team member will investigate each needed resource. Also include a column indicating whether or not material resources are needed from Dr. Hale.

|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|Test Organization| No | Lisa | We need an organization that we can test our measures and recommendations against.|
