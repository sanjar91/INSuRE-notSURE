## Executive Summary - Lisa & Sarah

> An executive summary should be evocative. It should capture a reader and make them want to be a part of your idea. In this milestone you will write an executive summary that defines the goals and objectives of your project in language that is easily readable and mental-image evoking. I (or anyone else) should be able to read your executive summary and instantly know a) what you are doing and b) why it is important. Executive summaries should be exciting and interesting. It is the first (and likely the only) chance for you to engage your reader and, in a real world setting, would determine if your product gets funded. An executive summary does not need technical detail to describe interesting functionality. You should mention your product by name without using phrases such as "the class", "the instructor", "project 2" etc.
Should contain the following:
>- A problem statement identifying relevant issues related to your bid. The problem statement might also discuss why these issues are a problematic for society, a particular industry/sector/company/agency, or a specific technology(ies).  
>- Project goals and objectives in a numbered or bulleted list that you propose to undertake to address the identified problem. Clearly identify what you are doing at a high level with minimal technical detail.
>- The merit of accomplishing the project goals and objectives in terms of how it helps end users, society, or particular industries/sectors/companies/agencies.

Team members that will be executing this project are:
1. Lisa Bazis
2. Sarah Noles
3. Collin Daily
4. Lyle Reinholz
5. Sanjar Hamidi

## Project Timeline - Sarah

> An important part of project planning is identifying tasks to be completed to address project goals and arranging those tasks in such a way that they can be completed within a (typically) fixed interval of time. In this class, that interval is the length of the semester. For milestone one, prepare an overall project timeline that identifies large tasks to be completed, estimates time of completion, and arranges those tasks chronologically over the project lifespan.  
>You should create a gantt chart and identify major tasks that span the rest of the semester. I suggest using a gantt chart creation tool such as ganttpro - but you may feel free to create one in a tool of your choice (a simple table is fine). Once your chart is created, save it as an image file and display it in your README.md file, beneath your executive summary on your GitHub repo.

## Risk List - Everyone put one in
>As you will probably discover, there are many things that can go wrong when working on a project. Issues with skillsets, technology, team member availability, etc, may arise as the project goes forward. As we discussed in class, there are three options available to deal with project management risks: monitor it (Watch it), mitigate it (do something about it), accept it (give up). For milestone one, you should identify the major sources of risk and what you plan to do about them. Prepare a risk list and rank them by risk level using the standard formula, i.e. impact x likelihood, to describe the top 5 risks that might affect your team's ability to pull off the tasks identified in your timeline and dictated by your objectives.

|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Some risk (40) | 8 | 5 | Some description  |

## Project Methodology
>Methodology is extremely important for conducting a successful project. While I am always a fan of "winging it" when it comes to day-to-day life - winging it is not an option for being successful on a team. Hence, in this class you will be required to develop a technical plan (AKA Methodology) to succeed. Your methodology should be grounded in scientific method and best practice. It should be based on the literature in the area you are working on and should use well-tested methods when possible.  
>Requirements are extremely important for conducting a successful project - of either the creative or assessment-oriented varieties. Collecting requirements about an application means understand what your end user (or what the end user of a product you are assessing) is going to do with the product. To understand requirements we often define user stories and use cases to encapsulate and represent behavior.  
> Submission Requirements
Sanjar & Collin:
> - Literature Review: For milestone 1, you should prepare a literature review document that surveys the various research and development work in your project area. Your literature review should identify important keywords, relevant research papers, and the state of the art in your area.
Lyle:
> - Technical Plan: Once you have examined the relevant literature, you should prepare a technical plan that outlines and defines your methodology. Important consideration should be made to ensure that your methodology uses the literature to the best extent possible. Your technical plan should provide a detailed description of exactly what and how you will do what you plan to do.  Any data collection, testing/development methods, architectures, and data analysis techniques that you wish to use should all be included in your technical plan.

## Requirements
> Clearly identify the technologies and products involved in your project.  clearly identify the technologies, products, and languages involved in your project. Include a table that identifies which team member will investigate each needed resource. Also include a column indicating whether or not material resources are needed from Dr. Hale.

|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|Test Organization| No | Lisa | We need an organization that we can test our measures and recommendations against.|
